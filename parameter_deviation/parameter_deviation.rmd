## why does this happen?
------------------------

Biotic responses to environmental change are often delayed through time.


---
<!--- intro _ debts/credits/delays explanation --->

## Background
------------------------

> Biotic responses to environmental change are often delayed through time.

<br>

Observed population and diversity metrics can be an __over/underestimation__ of the true capacity a landscape could support.

Imagine a population below or above carrying capacity.

------------------------

> Observed population and diversity metrics can be an over/underestimation of the true landscape capacity. 

<br>

Most predictive models of population dynamics and biodiversity do not control for this and __subconsciously make a pseudo-equilibrium assumption.__

## how did I get here?
------------------------

Previously understood how present biodiversity can be explained by a __mixture of past and present variables__ depending on the __magnitude, directionality and type__ of landscape change.

## <span style="color:#e71d36;font-size:110%">Extinction debts</span> and <span style="color:#1e90ff;font-size:110%">Colonisation credits</span>
------------------------

These delayed responses will manifest either as an:
<br><br>

<b><span style="color:crimson;font-size:170%">extinction debt</span></b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; new equilibrium < current biodiversity
<br>

or

<b><span style="color:dodgerblue;font-size:170%">colonisation credit</span></b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  new equilibrium > current biodiversity

---

## Why worry?
------------------------

- Ignoring <b><span style="color:crimson;font-size:150%"> debts </span></b> makes us over-optimistic of conservation as well as oblivious of extinctions that are already present but not yet manifested in the landscape.

- Ignoring <b><span style="color:dodgerblue;font-size:150%"> credits </span></b> will lead to under-estimates of the current status and result in superfluous policies and efforts that could be better placed.

Let's work towards it

Exploring the process leading to delays in population dynamics through time instead of a broader biodiversity approach

---

We started thinking how these delays impact modelling, inference and predictions, in particular for:

__spatially bound Species Distribution Models__ and 
__temporally explicit population trajectories__.

## <span style="color:#fc876a;font-size:110%"> Parameter shrinkage in space ?
---------------------------------

1. Species with increasing populations (K upward over time) 

2. Inference will underestimate relationship

3. Predictions will be more spatially homogeneous

<br>
Species will look more generalists and widespread while instead they should require targeted measures, 

highly relevant for invasive species control measures

## <span style="color:#4fb1f2;font-size:110%"> Parameter inflation in space ?
---------------------------------

1. Species with decreasing populations (K downward over time) 

2. Inference will overestimate relationship

3. Predictions will be more spatially heterogeneous

<br>
Species will look to be relying on specific conservation hotspots while instead they could require a more spatially broad habitat protection

## in development  .....

<br>
 - a case study show of the phenomena across continental scale and its implication for current policies 
 
 - defining an applicable law on how this works and ways to retrieve true parameter by knowing landscape history
 
 - viceversa on the above, if you know equilibrium and deviated parameters how long is your relaxation time, given nothing changes?
