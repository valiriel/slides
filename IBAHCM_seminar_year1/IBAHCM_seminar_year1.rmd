## Modelling COVID-19 incidence in Dhaka, Bangladesh

# Why?

- Analyze the spatio-temporal trends of COVID-19 within one of the most densely populated megacities in the world

- Identify hotspots areas and worrying trends to inform the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology

- Feel useful during lockdown and provide statistical and data analysis help for on-the-ground interventions

- To learn Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) modelling

## COVID-19 incidence across Dhaka

```{r, out.width='100%', echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=require('mapview')}
load("D:/GITHUB/DHAKA_COVID19_INLA/Dhaka_Data/Dhaka_Wards_SPATIAL.rda")
dhaka.wards <- dhaka.data
load("D:/GITHUB/DHAKA_COVID19_INLA/Dhaka_Data/Dhaka_Municipality_SPATIAL.rda")
dhaka.muni <- dhaka.data

m1 <- mapview::mapview(dhaka.wards, label="ID" , zcol="cases", alpha.regions = 0.8, map.types= c("CartoDB.Positron")) 

m2 <- mapview::mapview(dhaka.muni, label="ID" , zcol="cases", alpha.regions = 0.8, map.types= c("CartoDB.Positron"))

m1 + m2

```

---

## COVID-19 SIR across Dhaka 
Standardized Incidence Ratio (SIR) = observed cases / expected

```{r, out.width='100%', fig.height=5, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=require('mapview')}
load("D:/GITHUB/DHAKA_COVID19_INLA/Dhaka_Data/Dhaka_Wards_SPATIAL.rda")
dhaka.wards <- dhaka.data
load("D:/GITHUB/DHAKA_COVID19_INLA/Dhaka_Data/Dhaka_Municipality_SPATIAL.rda")
dhaka.muni <- dhaka.data

m3 <- mapview::mapview(dhaka.wards, label="ID" , zcol="SIR", alpha.regions = 0.8, map.types= c("CartoDB.Positron"), col.regions = viridis::cividis(n=10)) 

m4 <- mapview::mapview(dhaka.muni, label="ID" , zcol="SIR", alpha.regions = 0.8, map.types= c("CartoDB.Positron"), col.regions = viridis::cividis(n=6))

m3 + m4

```

## COVID-19 temporal trends across Dhaka wards

```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=9, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=require('mapview')}
load("D:/GITHUB/DHAKA_COVID19_INLA/Dhaka_Data/Processed_DATA/Dhaka_Municipality_CASES.rda")
library(tidyverse)

ggplot() +
  geom_line(data=dhaka.cases, aes(x=date, y=cases), color="deeppink") + 
    facet_wrap(~ID) + theme_minimal()

```

## Modelling COVID-19 incidence in Dhaka, Bangladesh

# INLA

A little to complex to explain in 5 minutes. 

Imagine a linear model where you can define random effects, in INLA these random effects can be unstructured (your common glmer RE) or structured:

- **structured temporal RE** based on models such as ar1, rw, ar2

- **structured spatial RE** based for example on distance between polygons 

- **spatiotemporal interactions** of the options above

# I can't really show results time and non-disclosure agreements for now

## Modelling COVID-19 incidence in Dhaka, Bangladesh

# In the end it didn't even matter

#### Take home messages

- Sometime the data is not good enough for the model

- Data collection needs to follow scientific protocols, especially during a pandemic

- Testing capacity was not up to standards

- I guess, at least I learned how to use INLA...

# Back to biodiversity and the main PhD

- Started 2 weeks ago so much of is still unsure

- I am currently focusing on shaping up a clear set of research questions

- The overall topic will focus on returning to the analysis of biodiversity response to landscape changes

- Temporal lags in the response of biodiversity to changes in landscape composition
  - Compare taxa responses
  - Frequency of landscape changes and their speed
  - Incorporate more landscape components heterogeneity, climatic
  - Analyze differences across spatial and temporal, size at which these process manifest
  - Explore sensitivity of biodiversity metrics, functional diversity and niche occupancy

- Explore ecosystems engineering and biodiversity optimization.
  -Rearranging spatial features to achieve a target biodiversity.
